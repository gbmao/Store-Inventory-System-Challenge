# Storage Inventory System 

##  Overview
The **Storage Inventory System Challenge** is a Java-based console project designed to manage and organize items across different contexts â€” including a **cart**, **inventory**, and **inventory aisle**.  
This project was built as a personal challenge to improve **Java Collections Framework** skills through practical implementation.

---

##  Purpose
The main goal of this project is to **train and strengthen Java Collections skills** by:
- Managing data using Lists, Sets, and Maps.
- Implementing item addition, removal, and lookup operations.
- Simulating real-world storage management logic (cart, stock, and aisles).
